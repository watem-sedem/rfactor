 - Two major bugs in the Matlab code are fixed.
 - Added Matlab code legacy.

Version 0.0.2
=============
New version that avoids the need to define an independent file providing the
links to all input data files needed to analyse the R-factor.

Previous functionalities are preserved, and work in the same way:

 - Compute the erosivity and R-factor values based on rainfall input data.
 - Analyse the computed erosivity and R-factor values (for Flanders).

Version 0.0.1
=============
 - Implemented R-factor Python processing functions.
 - Implemented Python wrapper for KULeuven `compute R-factor` Matlab script.
 - Implemented use of Octave to run Matlab scripts.
 - Set-up package.
 - Added examples and test data.
